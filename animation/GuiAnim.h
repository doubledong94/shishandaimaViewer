// use a vector<int colorvalue/sizevalue> anim to store an animation
// then use a int animCount to store the current play time, 
// for each frame, check if the play time is less then the size of the vector, and greater than -1
// if it is, get the next element of the vector anim and increase the int animCount by one
// if it is not, that means the animatin is not started or it is finished

// the problem unresolved is that how to generate vector anim, not by hand, but by algorithm
// search "animation curve by math" to solve this problem
